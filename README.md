## About The Center

![EDSI Logo](logo-edsi-icon.jpg)

The **Center for Educational Data Science and Innovation (EDSI)** at the University of Maryland (UMD) is a pioneering interdisciplinary research center dedicated to transforming education through cutting-edge data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and innovative research. Housed within UMD’s College of Education, EDSI is committed to advancing education equity, effectiveness, and efficiency by leveraging the power of data and AI technologies.

Our mission focuses on three core objectives:

- Accelerating innovative research that addresses critical educational challenges by integrating data science and AI methods to promote equity and improve learning outcomes for all students.

- Bridging educators, researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders to foster the ethical, evidence-based, and responsible use of data and AI in education.

- Transforming education systems by developing technological advancements and policy solutions that enhance educational equity, efficiency, and effectiveness.

EDSI leads groundbreaking projects such as collecting high-quality multimodal classroom datasets—including anonymized transcripts, audio, video, student demographics, achievement data, and surveys—combined with human annotations of teaching practices and student mathematical engagement. This rich, user-friendly data infrastructure supports AI model development and innovative educational tools aimed at high-impact, equity-focused teaching and learning improvements.

Committed to collaboration, EDSI works closely with diverse partners from across the University of Maryland, local school districts, education agencies, policymakers, and industry sponsors—including Google and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative—to implement data-driven strategies that improve educational experiences and outcomes. Through research, community engagement, and interdisciplinary partnerships, we strive to create equitable, effective, and efficient learning environments that benefit all students, particularly those from historically marginalized groups.

Our vision is to ethically harness data science and AI to shape the future of education, ensuring opportunities for all learners to thrive in an AI-enhanced world. Our GitHub organization serves as a transparent and collaborative space to develop, share, and maintain software and data projects that align with these goals.
